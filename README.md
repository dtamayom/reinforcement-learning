## Before you begin
We strongly suggest you create a specific conda enironment for this task. 
You will have to ensure that all installed dependencies are compatible, otherwise you will probably have issues while running.
The required dependencies and their corresponding compatible versions are included in the file `requirements.txt` and you can install them using pip install.
