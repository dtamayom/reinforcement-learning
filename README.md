## Before you begin
We strongly suggest you create a specific conda enironment for this task. 
You will have to ensure that all installed dependencies are compatible, otherwise you will probably have issues while running.
The required dependencies and their corresponding compatible versions are included in the file `requirements.txt` and you can install them using `pip instal`.

If you have any questions regarding the assignment or RL overall, you can contact us via email or through slack. Remember that you also have the [presentation](RL.pdf) available and the textbook reference books [here] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bDjUuXlv1xeuA2hJ1TjyjH6WJmZOPTR9?usp=sharing)
